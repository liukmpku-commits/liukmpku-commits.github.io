## 🔬 Research Experience

**Graduate Research Assistant | UW-Madison** *(08/2024 – Present)*
* Characterized the THz photoresponse of aerosol-jet printed graphene arrays utilizing lock-in amplification, validating a pure bolometric detection mechanism with a ~20 ms thermal time constant.
* Conducted precision cryogenic measurements on $NbSe_2$ nano-oscillators to analyze Duffing nonlinearity and extract nanomechanical parameters during superconducting phase transitions.
* Designed and manufactured a custom mechanical strain cell for *in-situ* uniaxial stretching, enabling the measurement of Raman peak splitting in 2D magnetic semiconductor $CrSBr$.
* Investigated quantum emission in thin-layer topological $TaIrTe_4$, characterizing photoluminescence and polarization dependence to identify Single Photon Emitters (SPEs).

**Short-term Academic Scholar | Rice University** *(08/2024 – 12/2024)*
* Analyzed Raman spectrum data and mapped intensity graphs of CMG films to establish the correlation between surface terrain and Raman enhancement effects.
* Improved COMSOL multiphysics simulations for Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS), successfully aligning theoretical models with experimental optical observations.
